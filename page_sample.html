                    <h3>Peruvian lily</h3>
                    <p> Peruvian lily flowers in late spring or
                        early
                        summer. The flowers are sensitive to fluoride, so let tap water sit for a few hours before
                        using.

                    <h3>Carnations</h3>
                    <p>Carnations are one of the longest-lasting cut flowers. They are also easy to grow from seed and
                        have
                        a
                        wonderful clove-like fragrance. Although they are most commonly thought of as flowering in
                        white,
                        pink,
                        and red, horticulturalists continue to develop new varieties in different hues.</p>

                    <h3>Gladiolus</h3>
                    <p>Gladiolus are among the most popular summer bulbs to grow. They can reach heights of four to six
                        feet
                        with their tall, spiky flower stalks. Gladiojus are thirsty cut flowers, so keep an eye on the
                        water
                        level and refill when necessary.
